When I posted last night I didn't realize it's possible top play with the draft
implementation (!!). Wow, it's great to finally be able to write this code.
Thanks for all the hard work.

------- 

Part of the reason people don't write types in function bodies is because they
can't write methods for them. This restriction can trap the type in the function
body, as it cannot be tranformed into an interface for use outside the function
body. Java allows anonymous classes to satisfy its version of interfaces, and
they are used a fair amount.

We can have the interface discussion in #25860. I would just say that in the era
of contracts, methods will become more important, so I suggest erring on the
side of empowering local types & people who like to write closures, not
weakening them.

(And to reiterate, please do not use strict go1 compatibility [vs virtually
99.999% compatibility, as I understand it] as a factor in deciding about this
feature.)

------- 

Regarding error handling, I had suspected generics might allow abstracting
common patterns for dealing with `(T1, T2, ..., error)` return tuples. I don't
have anything detailed in mind. Something like `type ErrPair(type T)
struct{T T; Err Error}` might be useful for chaining together actions, like
`Promise` in Java/TypeScript. Perhaps someone has thought through this more. An
attempt at writing a helper library and code that uses the library might be
worth looking at if you're looking for real usage.

With some experimentation I ended up with the following. I'd like to try this
technique on a larger example to see if using `ErrPair(T)` actually helps.

```go
type result struct {min, max point}

// without generics, lots of if err != nil 
func minMax(msg *inputTimeSeries) (result, error) { 
    start, err := time.Parse(layout, msg.start)
    if err != nil {
        return result{}, fmt.Errorf("bad start: %w", err)
    }
    end, err := time.Parse(layout, msg.end)
    if err != nil {
        return result{}, fmt.Errorf("bad end: %w", err)
	}
	min, max := argminmax(msg.inputPoints, func(p inputPoint) float64 {
		return float64(p.value)
	})
	mkPoint := func(ip inputPoint) point {
		return point{interpTime(start, end, ip.interp).Format(layout), ip.value}
	}
	return result{mkPoint(*min), mkPoint(*max)}, nil
}

// with a generic ErrPair type and generic function errMap2, similar
// to 
func minMax2(msg *inputTimeSeries) (result, error) {
	return errMap2(
		MakeErrPair(time.Parse(layout, msg.start)).withMessage("bad start"),
		MakeErrPair(time.Parse(layout, msg.end)).withMessage("bad end"),
		func(start, end time.Time) (result, error) {
			min, max := argminmax(msg.inputPoints, func(p inputPoint) float64 {
				return float64(p.value)
			})
			mkPoint := func(ip inputPoint) point {
				return point{interpTime(start, end, ip.interp).Format(layout), ip.value}
			}
			return result{mkPoint(*min), mkPoint(*max)}, nil
		}).tuple()
}

// Most languages look more like this.
func minMaxWithThrowing(msg *inputTimeSeries) result {
	start := time.Parse(layout, msg.start)) // might throw
    end := time.Parse(layout, msg.end)) // might throw
    min, max := argminmax(msg.inputPoints, func(p inputPoint) float64 {
        return float64(p.value)
    })
    mkPoint := func(ip inputPoint) point {
        return point{interpTime(start, end, ip.interp).Format(layout), ip.value}
    }
    return result{mkPoint(*min), mkPoint(*max)}
}
```

------- 

For general experimentation, I tried writing an S-Expression package
[here](https://github.com/gonzojive/go2-contracts-testing/blob/master/forms2/forms_test.go2).
I experienced some panics in the experimental implementation while trying to
work with compound types like `Form([]*Form(T))`. I can provide more feedback
after working around that, if it would be useful.

I also wasn't quite sure how to write a primitive type -> string function:
```go
contract PrimitiveType(T) {
    T bool, int, int8, int16, int32, int64, string, uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, float32, float64, complex64, complex128
    // string(T) is not a contract
}

func primitiveString(type T PrimitiveType(T))(t T) string  {
    // I'm not sure if this is an artifact of the experimental implementation or not.
    return string(t) // error: `cannot convert t (variable of type T) to string`
}
```
